# SQL (Structured Query Language) for Beginners

## Chapter 1: Introduction to SQL

* **Lesson 1. What is Structured Query Language (SQL) and why is it relevant?**
    * *Objective: To understand the role and significance of SQL in interacting with databases and its various use cases.*

* **Lesson 2: Relational Databases Concepts.**
    * *Objective: To understand what a relational database is, and then key concepts of tables such as rows, columns, primary and foreign keys and their significance in data manipulation.*

* **Lesson 3: Exploring a Sample Database.**
    * *Objective: A guided walkthrough of a typical relational database to familiarize learners with the structure.* 

## Chapter 2: DML (Data Manipulation Language) - Retrieving and Filtering Data

* **Lesson 1: Select specific columns and all columns.**
    * *Objective: Learn to use the SELECT statement to retrieve specific data from tables, selecting all columns or specific columns.*

* **Lesson 2: Filter data with the WHERE clause.**
    * *Objective: Use the WHERE clause to filter data based on specific operators and conditions.*

* **Lesson 3: Combine conditions with AND, OR, and NOT.**
    * *Objective: Expand on the previous lesson to apply multiple conditions using logical operators in the WHERE clause, for further refinement in data retrieval.*

* **Lesson 4: Sort data using ORDER BY.**
    * *Objective: Understand the GROUP BY clause and then implement to arrange data in ascending or descending order.*

## Chapter 3: DDL (Data Definition Language) - Modifying and Aggregating Data

* **Lesson 1: Insert data into tables.**
    * *Objective: Utilize the INSERT INTO statement to add new data to tables.*

* **Lesson 2: Update existing data.**
    * *Objective: Learn how to use the UPDATE statement to modify existing data in a table.*

* **Lesson 3: Delete data from tables.**
    * *Objective: Understand how to remove data from tables, using the DELETE FROM statement.*

* **Lesson 4: Counting and calculating with aggregate functions.**
    * *Objective: Summarize/aggregate data and perform calculations using aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX).*

## Chapter 4: Joining Tables

* **Lesson 1: Understanding table relationships and the need for joins.**
    * *Objective: Familiarize with the concept of relationships between multiple tables, and the role of joins in combining different tables.*

* **Lesson 2: Inner joins**
    * *Objective: To understand the logic behind an INNER JOIN, to retrieve data that matches from both joined tables.*

* **Lesson 3: Left and right joins**
    * *Objective: To understand the logic and the differences behind a LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, to extract data from a single table that has corresponding matches on the other table.*
